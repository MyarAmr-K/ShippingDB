# Online Store Database Diagram

This project contains a database diagram (Entity-Relationship Diagram or ERD) for an online store. It shows how different parts of the store's data are organized and connected.

## What is this?

This diagram visually represents the structure of the database that might be used to run an online store. It includes tables for:

* **Items (Products):** Information about the products sold.
* **Companies:** Details about the companies selling the products.
* **Customers:** Information about the people buying the products.
* **Orders:** Records of the purchases made.
* **Shipping:** Details on how orders are shipped.
* **And more!**

## Why is it useful?

This diagram can help:

* **Understand the data:** See how different pieces of information relate to each other.
* **Plan a database:** Use it as a blueprint for building a real database.
* **Learn about e-commerce:** See how an online store manages its data.

## How to use it

You can view the diagram directly on GitHub.  You can also download the image and open it with an image viewer.

## Key Concepts

* **Tables:** Like spreadsheets that store information (e.g., "Items", "Customers").
* **Columns:** The different types of information in a table (e.g., "Item Name", "Customer Address").
* **Relationships:** How tables are connected (e.g., a customer can place many orders).
* **Primary Keys:** Unique identifiers for each row in a table (e.g., "Item ID").
* **Auto-increment:** Automatically assigning unique numbers to primary keys.
